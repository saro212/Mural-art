        <h2>What Mural Art is all about?</h2>
        <p>Mural art involves creating large-scale paintings directly on walls, ceilings, or other permanent surfaces. It has a rich history, from prehistoric cave paintings to modern street art.</p>
        <p>Mural Art: A Journey Through Time and Space

            Mural art, like a silent storyteller, graces walls and ceilings across cultures and epochs. Let us explore the essence of this captivating form of expression.
            <br>
            <b><em>1. What is Mural Art?</em></b>
            <br>
            A mural is a painting that becomes an integral part of a wall or ceiling. It transcends mere decoration, weaving itself into the very fabric of architecture. While it may include paintings on fired tiles, it typically excludes mosaic decoration unless it forms an essential part of the overall composition¹.
            <br>
            <b><em>2. Nature and Technique</em></b>
            <br>
            <u>Organic Connection: Mural painting is unique—it breathes with the building. Colors, designs, and themes alter our perception of spatial proportions. It is truly three-dimensional, shaping and being shaped by its environment.
            Broad Public Significance: Murals convey social, religious, or patriotic themes. The artist must harmonize with the wall's structure and the idea expressed.
            Historical Technique:
            Encaustic Painting: In ancient Greco-Roman times, artists used molten beeswax as a binder for ground colors.
            Tempera Painting: Early practitioners used albuminous mediums like egg yolk or egg white diluted in water.
            Oil Paint on Canvas: By the 16th century, oil paint on canvas gained popularity for murals. Practicality drove its adoption—artists could complete the work in their studios and then transport it to its final location.</u>
            <br>
            <b><em>3. Cultural Impact and Evolution</em></b>
            <br>
            <i>Ancient Roots:</i> Mural art has an ancient lineage, spanning caves, temples, and public spaces.
            <i>Mexican Renaissance:</i> The Mexican Mural Movement of the 1920s reinvigorated murals. Artists like Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros used murals to educate, inspire, and address societal issues.
            <i>Contemporary Expressions:</i> Today, mural art continues to evolve. Vibrant Latin American and Mexican murals remain iconic, while urban graffiti murals challenge norms and engage communities⁴.
            <br>
            <b><em>4. Indian Mural Traditions</em></b>
            <br>
            <i>Ajanta Caves:</i> India boasts a rich tradition of mural art. The Ajanta Caves, dating back to ancient times, showcase exquisite frescoes. These vibrant, luminous paintings depict human figures in three dimensions, drawing inspiration from contemporary traditions like Kathakali and Kalam Ezhuthu⁵.
            
            In the dance of colors and narratives, murals connect us to history, culture, and shared experiences. They whisper tales of civilizations, dreams, and resilience—a testament to the enduring power of art.</p>
        <p>Examples of famous murals include Michelangelo's <b><em>Creation of Adam</em></b> in the Sistine Chapel and contemporary graffiti art in urban spaces.</p>
